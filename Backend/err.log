              'DO YOU HAVE A CODE OF CONDUCT?\n'
              'Yes, our code was first issued in 1996, revised in 2000, 2007, '
              'and again in 2015. It replicates the ETI Base Code as well as '
              'being underpinned by the ILO core conventions. You can find out '
              'more and download it here.\n'
              '\n'
              'HOW DO YOUR FACTORIES KNOW ABOUT YOUR CODE OF CONDUCT?\n'
              'Our Code of Conduct is communicated to all our suppliers when '
              'they begin trading with the Arcadia Group. Under our ethical '
              'audit programme, our suppliers must submit an independent '
              'third-party factory ethical audit less than 12 months old in '
              'order to receive a grading for a new factory set-up on Valid8, '
              'our online database. The system prompts them to communicate our '
              'Code of Conduct to each of their factories and confirm they '
              'understand and meet our minimum requirements. Our Code is also '
              'an integral part of the Supplier Handbook and is available on '
              'the supplier extranet. Our aim is for a programme of continuous '
              'improvement. Every purchase order includes the Code of Conduct '
              'as part of our Conditions of Trading.\n'
              '\n'
              'WHO MONITORS YOUR CODE OF CONDUCT?\n'
              'Factories used by our suppliers must submit a valid independent '
              'audit, before an order can be placed. These audits are carried '
              "out by some of the world's largest international auditing "
              'companies in the local language, against the Arcadia Code of '
              'Conduct. If issues are identified during the audit, a '
              'corrective action plan is agreed with the factory. We also '
              'review all audits internally and follow-ups may take place with '
              'the supplier in order to ensure compliance. You can read more '
              'about our Ethical Audit Programme here.\n'
              'In addition to this, our trained employees visit factories. '
              'Among other things, they will be looking for violations of our '
              'Code of Conduct or issues raised during an audit which have yet '
              'to be resolved. Any concerns will be discussed immediately '
              'with  factory management and we will work together with them to '
              'remedy the issue wherever possible, with emphasis on '
              'implementing a sustainable solution.\n'
              'WHAT SUPPORT DO YOU PROVIDE TO SUPPLIERS AND FACTORIES TO HELP '
              'THEM MEET THE CODE OF CONDUCT REQUIREMENTS?\n'
              'The Arcadia Group Code of Conduct Guidebook gives detailed '
              'explanations of our  expectations and how to meet them. This '
              'includes; a description of what is meant by each section of the '
              'code, relevant international laws or ILO conventions, common '
              'examples of non-compliance, documentation and management '
              'flowcharts to overcome these non-compliances as well as '
              'examples of best practice. You can read more and download the '
              'Guidebook here.\n'
              '\n'
              'DO YOU WORK WITH FACTORIES THAT USE CHILD LABOUR?\n'
              'We make it clear at the beginning of our relationship with a '
              'supplier that we will not work with any factory that employs '
              'children, this would be a serious violation of our code of '
              'conduct.\n'
              "Our code is aligned with the United Nations' definition of a "
              'child as any person less than 15 years of age unless local '
              'minimum law stipulates a higher age for work or mandatory '
              'schooling, in which case the higher shall apply. If, however, '
              'local minimum age law is set at 14 years of age, in accordance '
              'with developing country exceptions under ILO Convention No 138, '
              'the lower will apply.\n'
              "DO YOU SUPPORT FACTORY WORKERS' RIGHT TO JOIN A UNION?\n"
              'Yes, our code is very clear in this area:\n'
              'We believe that every worker has the right, without '
              'distinction, to join or form trade unions of their own choosing '
              'and to bargain collectively within the law of the land of the '
              'country concerned.We expect the employer to adopt an open '
              'attitude towards the activities of trade unions and their '
              "organisational activities.We expect that workers' "
              'representatives are not discriminated against and have access '
              'to carry out their representative functions in the '
              'workplace.Where the right to freedom of association and '
              'collective bargaining is restricted under law, we would expect '
              'that the employer facilitates, and does not hinder, the '
              'development of parallel means for independent and free '
              'association and bargaining.\n'
              'DO YOU SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF A LIVING WAGE AS OPPOSED TO A '
              'MINIMUM WAGE?\n'
              'Arcadia supports the position that all workers in our supply '
              'chain, including piece rate, subcontracted, informal, home and '
              'migrant workers, should always receive enough wages to meet '
              'their needs for nutritious food, clean water and other needs '
              '(shelter, transport etc.) as well as a discretionary income, '
              'which is now a generally well accepted definition of a living '
              'wage.\n'
              'The challenge is how to measure and then implement it. Until '
              'there is a universally agreed alternative, we rely on a solid '
              'benchmark specified by an ILO Convention and that is the '
              'minimum wage set by law in the appropriate country or local '
              'industry benchmark standards.This is a complex topic, as many '
              'other companies and organisations are finding. There are also a '
              'number of practical difficulties to agreeing and implementing a '
              "living wage. We don't own the factories that produce our "
              'merchandise so we do not employ the factory workers '
              'directly.You can read about our living wage projects here.\n'
              "WHICH COUNTRIES ARE ON YOUR 'BANNED' LIST?\n"
              'Currently our banned list includes North Korea, Uzbekistan, '
              'Turkmenistan and Iran. The list of acceptable countries is '
              'managed centrally by the Ethical Trading department.\n'
              '\n'
              'WHY DO YOU NOT HAVE A COUNTRY OF ORIGIN LABEL ON YOUR '
              'PRODUCTS?\n'
              'We do list the country of origin on the vast majority of our '
              'products. However, the fast fashion element of our business '
              'means that some suppliers have to be flexible about which of '
              'their factories they use to manufacture our goods and, as a '
              'result, do not list the country of origin. That said, all our '
              'suppliers still need to comply with our Code of Conduct.\n'
              '\n'
              'DO YOU USE FUR?\n'
              'No. We are committed to not selling any items made of real '
              'fur.\n'
              '\n'
              'DO YOU HAVE AN ANIMAL WELFARE POLICY?\n'
              'Yes.  All our suppliers are required to sign up to our animal '
              'welfare declaration as part of our conditions of trading. Our '
              'internet-based test report system automatically reminds '
              'suppliers of our animal welfare policy when they are asked to '
              'supply goods made from animal sources. In addition, further '
              'confirmations will be put in place by our new ethical audit '
              'database (Valid8).\n'
              'This will include reinforcing our ban on wool from producers '
              'that use mulesing as part of their animal husbandry '
              'techniques.Our  policy also states that Arcadia Group expects '
              'suppliers to adhere to the following sourcing '
              'standards:Leathers, skins and feathers must only be obtained as '
              'a by-product and not be the sole purpose of the slaughter of an '
              'animal.\n'
              'No products in full or part are to be sourced from endangered '
              'species from the CITES (Convention on International Trade in '
              'Endangered Species) or IUCN (International Union for the '
              'Conservation of Nature) lists; angora, mohair, real fur or '

              'Group.\n'
              'Leathers should not be obtained while an animal is alive.\n'
              'Feathers should not be plucked from live animals.\n'

              'DOES YOUR NIGHTWEAR MEET ALL CURRENT FLAMMABILITY LEGISLATION?\n'
              'Yes, the flammability of the clothing we sell complies with all '

              'Our own ethical trading programme – and its resultant code of '

              'ETI Base Code as well as being underpinned by the ILO core '

              'efficiency, waste reduction and transport initiatives in place '
              'since January 2006. We have seen some major improvements, '
              'including moving goods as efficiently as possible and simple '

              'We have procedures in place to ensure that all our suppliers '

              'We actively promote washing at lower temperatures, which can '

  'question': 'What is DebiCheck'},
 {'answer': 'DebiCheck is setting a new standard for debit order systems in '
            'the world. It requires you to confirm a new contract and mandate '
            'before it can be collected from your account. The bank is now '
            'able to verify whether the debit order information is correct '
            'before processing it. You cannot reverse a DebiCheck that was '
            'collected on the date and for the amount that you approved with '
            'your bank. You know who is collecting the money from your account '
            'and you can resolve any disputes with the service or credit '
            'provider.\n'
            'Other debit order mandates do not need your confirmation before '
            'it can be submitted for collection. Banks are unable to verify '
            'whether the debit order information is correct before processing '
            'it. If the collecting party has an invalid mandate, the EFT debit '
            'order will still be processed. Debit orders can be reversed '
            'immediately if disputed within 40 days.',

  'question': 'What is the difference between DebiCheck debit orders and other '
              'debit orders?'},
 {'answer': 'Capitec is in the process of implementing DebiCheck, but because '
            'it is a new system many service providers still need to get on '
            'board. So while all service providers will eventually be required '
            'to use DebiCheck, they might not be ready to give you the option '
            'yet.\n'
            'To give yourself peace of mind, ask the service or credit '
            "provider whether they use DebiCheck. If they don't, ensure that "
            'you have a copy of the signed contract or ask for a reference for '
            'the telephonically approved (voice) recorded mandate.It is not '
            'consumers, but the companies who use the debit order system that '
            'choose whether they want to use DebiCheck or not. You can ask the '
            'service or credit provider if they use DebiCheck to give yourself '
            'the peace of mind against incorrect and fraudulent debit orders '

  'category': 'https://www.capitecbank.co.za/help-centre/faqs/',
  'question': 'Can I choose which debit orders are confirmed using DebiCheck?'},
 {'answer': 'If a debit order does not match the information on the register '
            'at your bank, you may request that the bank suspend the debit '
            'order. The debit order will not be processed to your account in '
            'future but you should still contact your service provider to '
            'confirm that you are cancelling the debit order. Please note that '
            'suspending the debit order does not cancel the contract that you '
