Your fully branded platform means that Textlocal is hidden away in the background. You purchase SMS credits from Textlocal in bulk and these sit in your platform. These
credits are transferred to your customers when they make a purchase, however you must have enough credits in your account to be able to transfer them. These credits can be
sold to your customers at a competitive price, to maximise your profit margin. We will require a domain name with a secure (SSL) certificate to setup your branded platform.
We can usually do this within seven days, to get your service up and running on time. The fee for the service is £299.",Can we white label Textlocal Messenger?
